# Demos
A few demos and apps have been made to help understand pocketjs.

  1. Simple Chat
     - Live demo: [github.anuv.me/pocketjs/demos/chat-simple](http://github.anuv.me/pocketjs/demos/chat-simple/)
     - A simplistic instant messaging application
     - Barebones, no nicknames, only supports messages being posted
     - Not practical in real life, just a demo of basic realtime functionality

## Example Apps
Here are some applications I've made that use pocketjs for their core functionality:
  - rubbr
     - Play now: [rubbr.anuv.me](http://rubbr.anuv.me)
     - View source: [github.com/anuvgupta/rubbr](https://github.com/anuvgupta/rubbr)
     - An online multiplayer .io-style game (similar to [agar.io](http://agar.io)) in which players are cars, travel around a map, collect money and health, and blast through other players to damage/destroy them, thus gaining money and leaderboard points
         - pocketjs calculates every player's position & collisions, synchronizes the map (positions of money/players/health/nitro) as well as the leaderboard between all clients
  - slop
     - View online: [slop.anuv.me](http://slop.anuv.me)
         - *Password: slop*
     - View source: [github.com/anuvgupta/slop](https://github.com/anuvgupta/slop)
     - An online realtime collaborative grocery list app. Multiple lists may be created, with various names/purposes. New items can be added and removed, as well as crossed off.
         - pocketjs synchronizes all lists and items between all clients, so the changes by any one client are immediately reflected across all client devices (no reloading necessary)
